            <p>The robots.txt file is a simple text file used to tell Search Engines about the folders and files on
                the domain that may be crawled (looked at) by the search engineâ€™s crawler, as well as those that
                cannot/should not be seen.
                It is also good practice to include a link/reference to an XML sitemap in the robots.txt file.</p>
